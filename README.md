# cMILC_dust_synchrotron
cMILC is a code to extract Stokes Q, U maps of the different components from multi-frequency microwave maps. This code currently can estimate the foregrounds Q, U maps as well as clean foregrounds from CMB from WMAP and Planck simulation. The same code can be used for any data with minor modifications in the current version of the code. We marge two methods here: Describe the foregrounds in the moment expansion method following Chluba et al. (2017). Next, we de-project the higher order moments and extract the template of expected foregrounds/CMB using  Constrained Internal Linear Combination method (cMILC, Fern√°ndez-Cobos et al. (2016)). This code works over any sky fraction and is directly implemented on Q, U maps.
