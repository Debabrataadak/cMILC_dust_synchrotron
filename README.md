# cMILC_dust_synchrotron
Codes to extract dust and synchrotron Stokes Q, U maps from WMAP and  Planck frequency maps
The code can estimate the fogrounds Q, U maps as well as clean foregrounds from CMB from WMAP and Planck simulation. We marge two methods here: Describe the foregrounds in moment expansion method following Chluba et al. (2017). Next we de-project the heigher order moments and extract the template of expected foregrounds/CMB using Constrained Internal Linear Combination method (cMILC). This code works over any sky fraction and directly implimented on Q, U maps.
